      Over the past few years, I have developed various technical skills. 
      In programming, I have an intermediate level in C. I’ve used it to create programs involving pointers, arrays, functions, and file handling.
      I am also strengthening my Java skills <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/226/226777.png" alt="Java Icon">, particularly in object-oriented programming, thread management, and data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have solid experience with embedded systems like the Arduino Uno and the ESP8266. Through school projects, I have worked with various sensors, controlled motors (servo and stepper), displayed data on LCD screens, and transmitted this data to a mobile app.
    </p>
    <p>
      In web and mobile development, I have used core JavaScript <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968292.png" alt="JS Icon">, the Express.js framework to build web APIs, and Twig as a PHP template engine for my web pages. I’ve also started learning TypeScript <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968381.png" alt="TS Icon">, combined with React <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/919/919851.png" alt="React Icon">, to create a web interface displaying real-time data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding networking, I have learned to configure services like Apache, DHCP, and DNS servers. I’ve also practiced different SSH connections and set up a VPN using OpenVPN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I have programmed industrial PLCs from Siemens and Schneider, for example, to regulate the temperature of a box or to control a motor’s speed using PID control.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also comfortable using Microsoft Office 365 tools <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/732/732221.png" alt="Office Icon">, especially Word and PowerPoint, to write reports and design presentations.
