        Since my early years in primary school, I have always been a very quiet, calm and serious student. I was very studious: I often spent my breaks revising my lessons or doing math exercises. I enjoyed studying and understanding, and was curious to learn new things. I was especially passionate about mathematics. Thanks to this attitude, I was always at the top of the class in every subject except for physical education. That area was more challenging for me. I was not very comfortable doing some sports activities, especially swimming. Even though it was not my strength, I never gave up, and I always participated seriously and did my best.
        <br><br>
        In secondary school, I always chose the science and math track. I liked challenges and wanted to keep learning more complex things. The first two years went well; I had excellent results, and I was well organized. But in the third year, I went through a difficult time: I had to change schools in the middle of the year. The new school had already covered a lot of material I had not seen yet, and I felt a bit lost. I had to work even harder to catch up. It was stressful and took a lot of time, but I was determined to succeed. To reach my aim, I learned to manage my time better, and step by step, I started to improve. I consider that this challenge contributed to my personal development. It taught me important values because thanks to that I learned to be patient and organised, because results do not come immediately.

        After secondary school, I decided to go into industrial IT studies. I knew almost nothing about computing. In secondary school, my only IT course was about the basics of Word, so I had no knowledge of programming, electronics, or embedded systems. But this field had intrigued me for a long time. I was interested in web applications, connected objects, and websites.
        <br><br>
        In the first year, I quickly realised how different university was from secondary school. There were many more demands and more subjects to study, and the level was much higher. I wasnâ€™t prepared for this change. At the beginning, it was very hard for me. It was a completely new world. There were a lot of technical concepts, programming languages, electronics... these were subjects I was discovering for the first time in my life. I often felt pessimistic because I thought I was not good enough. But I did not give up. I attended tutoring sessions, I did extra exercises, and above all, I took the time to understand what I was doing truly. Thanks to these efforts, I improved in subjects that seemed impossible initially, like the analysis course.
        <br><br>
        I have not finished my studies yet, but I am proud of how far I have come. These years have helped me build confidence in myself and my abilities. I also learned what it means to have discipline, because motivation alone is insufficient.
        <br><br>
        Outside my studies, I enjoy walking and admiring nature, especially flowers. These moments help me release stress, clear my mind, and improve my concentration.
