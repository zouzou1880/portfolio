      <h1>Qualities </h1>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths is organization. I believe it is essential, professionally and in life in general. Over the years, I have learned to organize myself effectively: I use a planner, make to-do lists, and plan my revision schedule. This helps me manage my time well. When I work on a project, I write down each step to follow.
        This method keeps me calm and prevents me from feeling overwhelmed. It also helps me meet deadlines set by my professors. Without structure, you can quickly fall behind, leading to unnecessary stress.

        I also consider myself a creative person. Even though industrial IT is often seen as technical, I think creativity still plays an important role, especially in web development. I enjoy imagining a site's appearance, organizing content clearly, and trying out different colors or animations. For example, I added my personal touch to the web app in my second-year project. Thanks to that, I enjoy coding more. In my future career, I believe creativity will help me design unique websites that match client needs.

        I have always enjoyed understanding how things around me work, and that is one of the reasons I am drawn to IT. It is part of our everyday lives. When I discover a new language or tool, I like doing my own research and testing things out myself.
        This curiosity also keeps me from getting stuck for too long. For example, when my code does not work, I look for solutions on forums or in the official documentation. Through this kind of personal effort, I often learn things outside of the curriculum and expand my knowledge.

       <h1>Weaknesses</h1>
      <p>
        When I join a new group or start a project with people I donâ€™t know, I tend to be a bit reserved at first. I do not talk much initially; I prefer to observe and analyze the situation. However, once I feel comfortable, I become more sociable and participate more.
        For instance, during my first-year project, I completed my tasks but did not speak up much at first. After a short adaptation period, I interacted more with my group.
        Thanks to these projects at university, I have learned to speak up more quickly and express myself from the beginning. It helps me integrate into a group faster today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress is one of my weaknesses. When I have to manage several tasks at once, meet tight deadlines, or prepare for an oral presentation, I feel pressure.
        For example, during presentations for school projects, I felt overwhelmed by stress, even though I had studied well. Over time, I realised that stress never fully disappears, but you can learn how to manage it better. Now, I use techniques to deal with pressure more calmly. I am also learning to accept mistakes, especially in a field like IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another weakness I have noticed is that I am uncomfortable with improvisation, especially in academic or professional settings. I need time to prepare my answers and structure my ideas in advance to avoid mistakes or confusion. It reassures me to know I have thought things through before speaking or acting. However, during my studies, I understood that in some situations, like preparing a project, you have to react quickly, deal with the unexpected, and answer without everything being planned.
        That is why I am working on this point. What has helped me the most are the oral presentations I had to prepare and give throughout my studies. I am also trying to step out of my comfort zone by participating in more spontaneous conversations.
